This script, `move_files.py`, contains a function `move_files()` responsible for moving files from a landing directory to a processed directory. It utilizes the `os` and `shutil` modules for file and directory manipulation operations.

#### Main Functionality:

1. **Define Directories**:

   - Specifies the paths for the landing and processed directories where files are moved from and to, respectively.

2. **Move Files**:
   - Iterates through each folder in the landing directory.
   - Creates corresponding folders in the processed directory if they don't exist.
   - Moves each file from the landing directory to the processed directory using `shutil.move()`.

#### External Dependencies:

- `os`: Provides functions for interacting with the operating system, used here for directory traversal and creation.
- `shutil`: Offers high-level operations on files and collections of files, used for moving files between directories.

#### Additional Notes:

- The script assumes a simple directory structure where each subdirectory in the landing directory corresponds to a table, and files within these subdirectories are to be moved to the processed directory.
- It ensures that files are moved atomically and efficiently using `shutil.move()`.
- No logging or error handling is included in this script; errors related to file movement are propagated to the caller.
