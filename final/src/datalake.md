This script `convert_to_csv.py` reads JSON files from a specified directory, converts them into pandas DataFrames, and saves them as CSV files in another directory. It retrieves the list of table names from a JSON configuration file `jobs_config.json`, reads JSON files from the landing directory corresponding to each table name, normalizes the JSON data into a DataFrame, and saves it as a CSV file named with the current date. Finally, it logs the execution date using a logger.
