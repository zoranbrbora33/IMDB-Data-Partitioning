This script, `main.py`, orchestrates the execution of several modules/functions related to data processing tasks. It imports functions from three other Python scripts (`landing.py`, `datalake.py`, and `move_files.py`) and calls them within a `main()` function. It then checks if the script is being run directly and, if so, invokes the `main()` function.

#### Main Functionality:

1. **Import Modules**:

   - `landing.py`: Contains the `get_partitions()` function for retrieving data partitions.
   - `datalake.py`: Contains the `convert_to_csv()` function for converting JSON files to CSV format.
   - `move_files.py`: Contains the `move_files()` function for moving files to a different location.

2. **Execution Flow**:

   - Calls the `get_partitions()` function from `landing.py` to retrieve data partitions.
   - Calls the `convert_to_csv()` function from `datalake.py` to convert JSON files to CSV format.
   - Calls the `move_files()` function from `move_files.py` to move files to a different location.

3. **Script Invocation**:
   - The `main()` function serves as the entry point for execution.
   - It is invoked when the script is run directly (`if __name__ == "__main__": main()`).

#### Additional Notes:

- The script utilizes a modular structure, separating different tasks into individual files (`landing.py`, `datalake.py`, `move_files.py`).
- It provides a clear and organized approach to data processing tasks, enhancing maintainability and readability.
- The code within the `main()` function is executed in sequential order, ensuring proper coordination of tasks.
